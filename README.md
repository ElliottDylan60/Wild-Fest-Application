# WILD FEST Application
The WILD FEST 2022 Application Backend for CWU.

WILD FEST is a free event put on at Central Washington University featuring activities, food, and live music. WILD FEST is the largest student appriciation event at CWU.

## My Contribution
This is the backend code on 881theburg.com that was responsible for gathering and manipulating data for students to apply for a chance to play at WILD FEST and vote on their favorite bands.

This code is, for the most part, the complete working code used on our site. I removed some key elements from the page for security reason, such as database names and other sensitive information. With a correct implementation of the database and naming convention the code will function.

This is for my portfolio and is not intended to be downloaded and used. Although nothing is stopping you from trying to use this code.



## Database Schema
Here is a basic relational schema of how the data is stored. This schema is not finished and does not reflect the entire relational schema. This code was written for a WIX site and thus database schema is not accurate to actual implementation.
